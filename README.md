## Title
**Heuristic Evaluation of Competing Food Websites: Zomato vs swiggy**

---

## Aim
Perform a heuristic evaluation comparing the user experience (UX) of two competing e-commerce websites (Amazon.in and Flipkart). Identify usability issues using Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics, propose prioritized changes, and implement a minimal front-end prototype (HTML/CSS/JS snippets) that addresses selected issues. Prepare a lab report and push the project to a GitHub repository.



## Algorithm / Method (Step-by-step)
1. Define context & tasks — search, listing, PDP, add to cart, checkout.  
2. Choose heuristics — Nielsen’s 10.  
3. Walkthrough tasks and note heuristic violations.  
4. Rate severity (0–4).  
5. Prioritize fixes (severity × frequency × persistence).  
6. Design solutions with code snippets.  
7. Build minimal prototype (listing & PDP).  
8. Document findings and repo URL.

## Heuristic Evaluation — Issues & Fixes

1. Visibility of System Status

Zomato: Shows clear order tracking, but sometimes restaurant availability status is inconsistent.

Swiggy: Real-time updates during delivery are very clear (e.g., rider location tracking).
✅ Swiggy leads.

2. Match Between System and Real World

Zomato: Uses familiar restaurant-like categorization (e.g., "Dine-in," "Delivery").

Swiggy: Uses casual, conversational tone like “What’s on your mind?” — relatable for users.
✅ Swiggy slightly better.

3. User Control and Freedom

Zomato: Easy navigation, but fewer undo/cancel options during checkout.

Swiggy: Allows easy cart edits, address switching, and cancelling orders (within time limit).
✅ Swiggy is stronger.

4. Consistency and Standards

Zomato: Icons and layouts are consistent but sometimes cluttered with promotions.

Swiggy: More consistent design patterns, cleaner cart and checkout experience.
✅ Swiggy better maintained.

5. Error Prevention

Zomato: Sometimes allows adding unavailable items (error shows later).

Swiggy: Blocks unavailable items upfront, minimizing user frustration.
✅ Swiggy wins.

6. Recognition Rather Than Recall

Zomato: Good use of previous orders and search suggestions.

Swiggy: Strong recommendations based on history, clear shortcuts.
⚖️ Both are competitive here.

7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use

Zomato: Has shortcuts like “Repeat last order.”

Swiggy: More flexible with filters (veg-only toggle, delivery time, offers).
✅ Swiggy offers more efficiency.

8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

Zomato: Bold visuals, but too many ads/offers clutter interface.

Swiggy: Cleaner, minimalist design, more white space.
✅ Swiggy leads.

9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors

Zomato: Error messages exist but are vague (“Something went wrong”).

Swiggy: More specific error messages (e.g., “Restaurant closed” or “Payment failed”).
✅ Swiggy better.

10. Help and Documentation

Zomato: Help section available but less intuitive.

Swiggy: Better structured FAQs and customer support integration.
✅ Swiggy leads.

## OUTPUT:
Comparison Summary:

Swiggy outperforms Zomato in most heuristics — especially in error prevention, aesthetics, and system feedback.

Zomato is visually appealing but suffers from clutter and weaker error handling.
