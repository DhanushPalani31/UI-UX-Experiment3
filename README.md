## Title
**Heuristic Evaluation of Competing Food Websites: Zomato vs swiggy**

---

## Aim
Perform a heuristic evaluation comparing the user experience (UX) of two competing e-commerce websites (Amazon.in and Flipkart). Identify usability issues using Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics, propose prioritized changes, and implement a minimal front-end prototype (HTML/CSS/JS snippets) that addresses selected issues. Prepare a lab report and push the project to a GitHub repository.

---

## Scope
- **Platforms evaluated**: Desktop web experiences of Amazon.in and Flipkart (product search, product listing, product details, cart flow).  
- **Method**: Expert heuristic evaluation (3 evaluators hypothetical — consolidated findings), severity ratings and recommended fixes.  
- **Deliverables**: Lab report PDF, GitHub repo with prototype folder and README.

## Algorithm / Method (Step-by-step)
1. Define context & tasks — search, listing, PDP, add to cart, checkout.  
2. Choose heuristics — Nielsen’s 10.  
3. Walkthrough tasks and note heuristic violations.  
4. Rate severity (0–4).  
5. Prioritize fixes (severity × frequency × persistence).  
6. Design solutions with code snippets.  
7. Build minimal prototype (listing & PDP).  
8. Document findings and repo URL.

## Heuristic Evaluation — Issues & Fixes

### Problem A — Losing filter & scroll state when returning from PDP (Flipkart) — *Severity 3*
**Issue**: Filters/scroll lost when returning → frustration.  
**Fix**: Persist state in URL + `sessionStorage`.  


## OUTPUT:
Heuristic Evaluation of Competing Food Websites: Swiggy vs Zomato is implemented successfully.
